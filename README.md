# Hostel_management_system-
A Hostel Management System (HMS) is a software solution that automates administrative tasks in hostel management. It efficiently handles room allocations, student records, and facility management, student complaints. Technologies such as Spring, AJAX, HTML, and Hibernate enhance its capabilities for a robust development foundation.

Technologies Used in Hostel Management System:

<h5> Spring Framework:</h5>

Utilize the Spring framework for building a modular and scalable application.
Leverage features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and data access abstraction.


<h5> AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): </h5>

Enhance the user experience by implementing asynchronous communication between the client and server.
Enable dynamic content updates without requiring a full page reload.


<h5> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): </h5>

Develop the user interface using HTML for creating structured and visually appealing web pages.
Ensure compatibility and responsiveness across different devices.


<h5> Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): </h5>

Implement Hibernate for seamless integration with relational databases.
Simplify database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.



<h1>Project Aim</h1>

The aim of the project is to develop and implement a tailored Hostel Management System for 
the University of Ruhuna Faculty of Technology. This system will automate the complaints 
and grievances handling process within the campus hostels, providing students and staff with 
a user-friendly platform to submit and resolve complaints related to hostel assets. 
Additionally, the system will facilitate efficient asset oversight and generate reports 
summarizing complaints for transparent management. Ultimately, the goal is to alleviate the 
challenges faced by students and staff in the current manual complaint-handling process and 
establish a more efficient and transparent system for managing hostel assets and addressing 
student concerns
